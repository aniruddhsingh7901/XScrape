You get to August and re-run it and now it shows $720 of a refund.  Maybe that's because the old calculations were not accurate, or your pay rate changed, or whatever.\n\nYou can now update your W4 and it will get you back to $0 owed (or close to it).  What you want to do in practice is typically do the calculation once or twice a year, or more often if things have changed (new job, promotion, got married, whatever).  If it starts moving off from reality yet, update your actual W4.", "createdAt": "2025-09-19T15:12:00+00:00", "dataType": "comment", "title": null, "parentId": "t1_neoa07p", "media": null, "is_nsfw": false, "score": null, "upvote_ratio": null, "num_comments": null}
